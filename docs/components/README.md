# Components

This section contains all the use cases and design choices for different React components.

A few things to note regarding how these components are documented:

-   Components marked as <span class="ghost">dead code</span> are most likely removed for being placeholder UI for future functionalities.
-   Almost every component's documentation has two main attributes included:
    1. Absolute path from project root to its code.
    2. A table that describes any hooks being used by the respective components.
